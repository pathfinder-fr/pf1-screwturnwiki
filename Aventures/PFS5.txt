{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 1–5, par Mike Shel<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>A Pathfinder leading a diplomatic envoy from the dwarven holds of the Five Kings Mountains has gone missing, and the balance of power in a time of war hangs on her rescue. The Pathfinder Society's divinations indicate the agent was waylaid in the theocratic nation of Razmiran, when one of her escorted diplomats failed to pay a requested tithe. Now it falls to the party to enter Razmiran, locate the missing Pathfinder and the dwarven diplomats, and escape with their lives.

{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 3–7, par Alex Greenshields<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>All-out war has erupted on the long-contested border between the crusader nation of Mendev and the demon-infested Worldwound. With the magical defenses that once held the demons at bay failing, defense of the region now falls to small patrols of mobile soldiers to resupply, reinforce, and communicate between the border's many fortresses and outposts. With so much at stake, the Pathfinder Society has enlisted many of its agents to assist in the war effort, both to protect its own interests and to prevent the onrushing tide of demonic attackers from plunging the entire Inner Sea region into chaos. On one such wardstone patrol, however, the party may find itself facing an enemy of an entirely different nature.

{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 5–9, par Tom Phillips<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>War between demons and the civilized peoples of the Inner Sea region has broken out in the Worldwound far to the north of Absalom, but despite the regional implications of an Abyssal victory, many nations are ambivalent toward the cause. The Pathfinder Society, at the urging of Silver Crusade leader Ollysta Zadrian, arranges a formal banquet to be hosted by newlyweds Michellia and Damian Blakros, at which the society's agents can attempt to sway the political opinions of Absalom's movers and shakers. Will the Pathfinders succeed in securing the much-needed military support of Absalom and other nations bordering the Inner Sea, or will the crusaders and Pathfinders fighting on the front lines in Mendev find themselves standing alone before the demonic hordes ?

{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 1–5, par David N. Ross <br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>The Mendevian Crusade draws heavily on the Pathfinder Society’s resources, and unless the Decemvirate can secure the assistance of generous patrons, the society may not have sufficient capital both to fight off the demonic invasion and to prepare its expedition to a lost historical site within the Worldwound. Upon hearing that the daughter of an eminent and wealthy of citizen of Sauerton has gone missing, the Pathfinders rush to her aid in the hope of earning her father’s goodwill and support in upcoming endeavors.

{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 7-11, par Ryan Costello, Jr<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/> Nearly every nation has contributed to the Mendevian Crusade, but few are willing to send additional aid to assist the Pathfinder Society directly. Owed a favor the elves cannot refuse, Pathfinders travel to Kyonin to secure a force of some of the finest demon-hunters in Avistan only to find that the hunters are missing in action. Can the Pathfinders extract the lost elves from the depths of Tanglebriar, or will they become the latest casualties of Treerazer’s domain ?

{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 3-7, par Sean McGowan <br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/> As an act of retribution, an enemy of the society begins hiring river pirates to waylay Pathfinder boats bound for the crusader nation of Mendev. Unless the Pathfinders can track down the party responsible and put an end to their piracy, the raids may spell the doom of the society’s ambitions to the north.

{s:BookPic||}
{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 5-9, par Ben McFarland <br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/> Few are as adept at fighting demons as the Riftwardens, an organization of spellcasters dedicated to protecting the boundaries between the planes. Many are already committed to the Fifth Crusade in Mendev and are unable to assist the Pathfinders directly in the society’s upcoming expedition into the Worldwound, but if the Pathfinders assist the Riftwardens elsewhere, perhaps a small number of the mages might be free to return the favor. Unfortunately, this means entering the godless nation Rahadoum, where several Riftwardens have recently disappeared.

{s:BookPic||}
{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 1–2, par Kyle Baird<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>Almost all Pathfinders undergo extensive training for three or more years to learn the tricks of the trade, and their last test before graduating from the ranks of the initiates to the status of a full Pathfinder agent is the Confirmation, a special research project that involves considerable fieldwork and is designed to simulate the initiates' future work as a Pathfinder. Even the noteworthy field commissioned agents sometimes participate in such trials as a way to familiarize themselves with the Pathfinder Society’s rules and expectations. Although Confirmation is typically an individual affair, the society recently discovered a site on the Isle of Kortos that would be perfect for initiates but perhaps too dangerous to handle alone. Successfully uncovering this site’s secrets will not only contribute to the society’s body of knowledge but shape the exciting careers ahead for each of the prospective agents.

{s:BookPic||}
{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 3–7, par Thurston Hillman<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>During the recent attack on Nerosyan, Pathfinders sought out a local venture-captain to aid in the city’s defense. What they found instead suggested the leader had not only fled recently but had played a part in the demons’ offensive. Venture-Captain Jorsal has determined that the safety and integrity of the Pathfinder Society requires that a team delve into the sealed basement beneath the abandoned lodge to determine what other plans his turncoat colleague may have set in motion.

{s:BookPic||}
{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 7–11, par Jerall Toi<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>Despite several promising developments on the front lines, it’s increasingly clear to the Pathfinder Society that fighting its way across the entire Worldwound would prove far more costly than approaching the Sky Citadel Jormurdun from the west. What it might gain in ease of use, the society lacks in an established basecamp, so the PCs must travel to the Realm of the Mammoth Lords to win over the locals and secure a beachhead—all without falling prey to the area’s powerful megafauna, savage demons, and relentless barbarian tribes.

{s:BookPic||}
{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 1–5, par Kyle Elliot<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>Few societies have so vaunted a tradition of leading crusades as Taldor, yet the constant revisions to its history by scheming factions leaves the truth obscured by countless acts of political modifications. Even the lauded Kitharodian Academy’s texts are riddled with these changes, so when a secretive ally approaches the Pathfinder Society with information about a hidden archive that contains the unaltered histories, the Pathfinders plan a daring infiltration to recover the secrets of Taldor’s past victories so that Mendev might benefit from the discovery.

{s:BookPic||}
{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 1–5, par Scott Fernandez, RPG Superstar 2013 finalist<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>Amenopheus has learned that the legacy of the Jeweled Sages lies near the Osirian trade city of Eto, and the Pathfinder Society has pledged its support in the Sapphire Sage’s investigation of his ancient order; however the lead dried up—that was until a familiar information broker contacted Amenopheus offering an exchange of services. To assist an ally and unlock the secrets of Osirion’s past, the Society must deal with a deadly antagonist once more by sending the PCs to fulfill the bargain and collect its due. The only question is what price their foe will demand.

“A Bitter Bargain” is the first scenario in the three-part Destiny of the Sands campaign arc. It is followed by Pathfinder Society Scenario #5–15: Destiny of the Sands—Part 2: "Race to Seeker’s Folly" and Pathfinder Society Scenario #5–16: Destiny of the Sands—Part 3: "Sanctum of the Sages."

{s:BookPic||}
{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 5–9, par Nathan King<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>Dire need begets great innovation, and Ghalcor, a cleric of Iomedae, created a revolutionary new weapon to fight the demons that poured out of the Worldwound at the end of the First Mendevian Crusade. Unfortunately, the fiends overwhelmed Ghalcor and his assistants before they could arm and trigger the weapon, but complex fail-safes sealed off Ghalcor’s tower and kept the device from falling into abyssal hands. As the Fifth Mendevian Crusade rages on, Ghalcor’s secret weapon could be the factor that turns the tide, so the Pathfinder Society has agreed to find a way past the indiscriminate safeguards to secure the device for the crusaders—a task complicated by their pushing past enemy lines.

{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 3–7, par Larry Wilhelm<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>The Blakros family, long an ally of the Pathfinder Society, has come into possession of a manor house in the imperial nation of Cheliax, where a once prominent noble family was known to practice diabolism before the Age of Lost Omens. The Pathfinders' task is simple: clear the abandoned manor of any remaining threats before the Blakroses move in. Unfortunately, the estate hasn't sat empty as long as the Blakroses think it has, and its recent inhabitants were anything but the devil-worshipers who originally built the manor.

The Pathfinders must endure the scalding Osirian desert, brave its inhabitants, and watch for hidden dangers if they are to survive. Can the PCs reach the ruins before their rivals claim the prize?

When the trail leads to the sages’ hidden sanctum deep within the Pillars of the Sun, the Pathfinders must draw upon both their own resourcefulness and the ancient historians’ power if they are to preserve a millennia-old organization and Osirion’s past.

“Sanctum of the Sages” is the final scenario in the three-part Destiny of the Sands campaign arc.

Reports recently ceased after scholars reported finding a sealed chamber believed to contain cadres of battle golems untouched since the Jistka Imperium’s collapse. The Pathfinder Society hopes to recover the golems for study and possible use in the Worldwound, but can its agents reach the sealed storeroom before the constructs fall into enemy hands? “Fate of the Fiend” is the spiritual sequel to “Fingerprints of the Fiend” and “Fury of the Fiend,” though the scenarios can be played in any order.

When her agents learned of a dormant relic that might be awakened, she petitioned the Pathfinder Society for its aid in recovering this so-called Horn of Aroden, knowing that the Society would benefit from her army’s hastened arrival.

As an act of support, the Pathfinder Society sends the PCs as representatives to the event; however the death of such an influential merchant and politician has created a considerable power vacuum, and ambitious acquaintances from across the Inner Sea are in attendance to pay their respects, claim a piece of the trade prince’s legacy, and undercut their rivals’ attempts to do the same.
