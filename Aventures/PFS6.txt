{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 1, par Josh Foster, Scott Sharplin, and Walter Sheppard<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>A series of six Quests designed for 1st-level characters.

When the daring half-orc scholar Ulisha enrages a noble family in the River Kingdoms, she contacts the PCs with a special deal: she will sell them a unique and ancient druidic relic at a steep discount to secure the gold she needs to pay off her bounty. By the time the PCs arrive to meet her, she has gone into hiding. However, she has left behind a journal full of profitable leads as a sign of good faith. Can the PCs recover this hidden wealth and claim the powerful Silverhex before an assassin finds their friend?

The Silverhex Chronicles includes six, 1-hour adventures that take the PCs to a graveyard in Gralton, a mist-choked forest in Ustalav, a brainwashed village in Razmiran, an ancient crash site in Numeria, and the perilous city of Daggermark. Experience the adventures in any order to create a unique story.

{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 3–7, par Justin Juan<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>For centuries the city of Bloodcove has controlled access to the invaluable Vanji River, and for nearly as long, the Aspis Consortium has controlled Bloodcove. If the Pathfinder Society is to move the equipment and personnel it needs into the Mwangi Expanse, it needs a reliable means of smuggling resources through this unforgiving settlement operated by its enemies.

Today, despite having allied itself with Venture-Captain Amara Li’s thriving Lantern Lodge and funded the Pathfinder Society’s endeavors in Tian Xia, the Way controls only a handful of its once-extensive web of strongholds. One of its leaders in Kwanlai has decided that it is time for Amara Li to demonstrate her dedication to her allies: by recovering one of the order’s most treasured relics lost in the swamps of Wanshou. It is up to the PCs to brave the realm of a kraken god-king in order to keep the Society’s alliance intact.
