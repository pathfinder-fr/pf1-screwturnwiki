{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 1-5, par Sean McGowan<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>Rival explorers have beaten the Pathfinders to a valuable site in Katapesh, but fortunately most of the riches—including the obscure text the Society sought in the first place—have ended up in the capitol’s extensive bazaars. What is at first a routine shopping trip spirals out of control as the PCs uncovers the writing’s secret past—and secret messages.

{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 3-7, par Liz Courts<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>A strange confluence of circumstances leaves the researchers of Uringen understaffed and in need of able-bodied assistants. Conveniently, recent Pathfinder Society experiments call for a rare reagent found only in that area, and the two organizations have negotiated a mutually beneficial deal. Can the PCs reach the secluded settlement in time to witness this extraordinary event—and handle the phenomenon’s aftermath?

{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 7-11, par John Compton and Linda Zayas-Palmer<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>The cataclysmic Earthfall shattered the ancient Thassilonian civilization, and like its slumbering runelords who fled the destruction, many ruins lie hidden. The Ironbound Archipelago was once part of Edasseril, kingdom of envy, and word has reached the Pathfinder Society that an ancient ruin has emerged on the isle of Flintyreach. Can the PCs gain the local half-orcs’ trust and brave the resident giants’ wrath to secure this archaeological treasure?

The cycle continues until he has earned a righteous place in the afterlife. After years of service and lifetimes of accomplishment, Venture-Captain Bakten nears the end of his noble existence and has begun investigating his past lives as a means of understanding Tian Xia's rich history. However, he cannot complete his research alone, and only with the PCs' assistance can they decipher the region's past.

{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 1-5, par Benjamin Bruck<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>Less than a decade ago, the Pathfinder Society established a lodge in Nirmathas, an act that infuriated the nation's expansionist rival Molthune. The latter outlawed the Society soon after, and ever since Pathfinders have relied on smugglers like the Varisian entrepreneur Guaril Karela to slip supplies past the Molthuni blockade for both the lodge and the Society's war-torn neighbors. Something has intercepted those shipments. Can the PCs uncover the culprit and save the Society's reputation in Nirmathas?

{s:BookPic||}
{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 5-9, par Robert Brookes<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>A recent attack on the Grand Lodge became all the more heinous when one of the invading agents employed an eldritch relic to abduct a high-ranking Pathfinder. In order to release the captive, the Society must understand the relic and track down the fleeing operative—a mission that leads the PCs into Absalom's most prestigious archives to uncover a dark secret.

{s:BookPic||}
{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 1-2, par Mike Kimmel<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>The Aspis Consortium pays well, but few can stand its underhanded tactics for long. One operative fed up with the Consortium's practices has contacted the Pathfinder Society with a tempting offer: assist her in leaving the organization, and she will supply the Society with years of insider intelligence about their longstanding rival. It's up to the PCs to navigate Diobel—a proud town run by cutthroat smugglers—earn the defector's trust, and deal a telling blow to their Aspis foes.

"The Consortium Compact" is an evergreen, replayable scenario designed to help introduce players to the Pathfinder Society, the Isle of Kortos, and one of the Society's longstanding rivals.

{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 7-11, par Mikko Kallio<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>When the Jeweled Sages, an ancient order of Osirian scholars, fled Qadiran invaders millennia ago, some perished, and others disappeared deep into territories once held by the pharaohs of old. With the help of the Jeweled Sages' long-abandoned tools, the eminent Tahonikepsu has discovered one of the sages' last known whereabouts in the wilds of Nex.

{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 1-5, par Jon Cazares<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>A magical war between the archmages Geb and Nex left the landscape between their nations scarred and wracked by magical anomalies—a barren stretch known as the Mana Wastes. During the conflict, their generals also created countless weapons and defenses that pushed the limits of magic, yet most of these were destroyed in battle or lost forever. Recent investigations suggest that some of this ancient power is at play in an insular town outside Alkenstar, but there the trail runs cold. Can the PCs uncover the truth while braving the residents' eccentricities?

The Decemvirate has reopened the decade-old case of the most qualified replacement: Aram Zey's predecessor and former Master of Spells Sorrina Westyr, who disappeared while handling a powerful wayfinder that the Society has since kept closely guarded. It is up to the PCs to track down Sorrina Westyr—and bring back whatever remains.

{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 1-5, par Brian J. Fruzen, RPG Superstar 2015 finalist<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>Ever since the tragedy at Delvehaven decades ago, the infernal empire Cheliax has rarely allowed Pathfinders to explore its many ruins and archaeological treasures—even then only after its recently disenfranchised liaison Zarta Dralneen fought for that privilege. Cheliax has once again extended its hand to the Society, inviting its agents to investigate an abandoned keep that dates back to the Chelish civil war. It's up to the PCs to navigate the Corentyn's streets and politics as they uncover the buried past and lay the foundation for a new partnership with a one-time foe.

"Let Bygones Be" is the first scenario in the three-part Faithless and Forgotten campaign arc. It is followed by Pathfinder Society Scenario #7-16: "Lost Colony of Taldor" and Pathfinder Society Scenarios #7-18: "The Infernal Inheritance." All three chapters are intended to be played in order.

{s:BookPic||}
{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 3-7, par Nathan King<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>When the Pathfinder Society claimed the Hao Jin Tapestry in Tian Xia, it seemed as though the Aspis Consortium's influence there had ended. An anonymous informant recently identified an Aspis resurgence in Goka's Deepmarket, and Venture-Captain Amara Li hopes that a small, well-trained team can ferret out the villains and prevent any greater atrocities. Can the PCs traverse the Deepmarket's treacherous politics and tunnels and neutralize the Consortium's local ringleader?

{s:BookComment|'''Niveau''' 1-5, par Kalervo Oikarinen<br/>NC (nc) - '''Cycle''' xx<br/><br/>The Society’s excavations continue, now taking the PCs to the long-contested territory of Kharijite—Cheliax’s southernmost territory, where the great Arch of Aroden bridges the Hespereth Strait and establishes an Avistani foothold in Rahadoum’s backyard. There, an ancient Taldan ruin suggests that empire’s great Armies of Exploration traveled even farther than believed possible. Can the PCs uncover the site’s secrets—and in doing so reshape the Inner Sea region’s history?

The Pathfinder Society, as one of the crusade’s partners in this endeavor, has earned the right to explore and salvage what it can of the lost Sarkorian sites under Mendev’s control, and it has identified one ruin as a priority. In fact, the site seems to actively call to one agent in particular, a scarred survivor of abyssal experiments. Venture-Captain Jorsal of Lauterbury has asked the PCs to accompany this agent into the wasteland, where perhaps she might learn how to control her demonic half—or purge it completely.

After both of his last two shipments disappeared without a trace, the ruler of Pashow has retained the services of the Pathfinder Society to ensure that this year the elixir arrives unharmed and restores prosperity to his realm. However, what begins as an unusual security assignment quickly spirals into a revelatory unveiling of Pashow’s treacherous underbelly.

After his shipments of sun orchid elixir vanished without a trace two years in a row, the ruler of Pashow is desperate to ensure that his next delivery goes off without a hitch.

The mass migration never happened. Always seeking a return on investment, Druma recently began auctioning off control of the city to the highest bidders and wealthiest entrepreneurs for five years at a time. The next auction begins soon, and the powerful Aspis Consortium gold agent Myrosype—an enemy of the Society responsible for countless Pathfinders’ deaths—is poised to take control of the whole city for her own nefarious ends. The Society has secured a few invitations for the PCs to attend the auction.
