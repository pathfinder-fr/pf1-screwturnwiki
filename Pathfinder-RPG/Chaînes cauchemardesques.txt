'''Avantage.''' 


(((
Nightmare Chains

Chains are a kyton’s inheritance and dominion.

Prerequisites: Kyton subtype, 5 or more Hit Dice.

Benefit: You gain the kyton’s dancing chains ability (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary 185), except you can control only up to two chains this way. This grants you two chain attacks, which deal damage as per a spiked chain made for a creature of your size. If you already have the dancing chains ability, you can control two additional chains.

Special: At the GM’s discretion, non-kyton outsiders can select this feat if they have a thematic link to chains (such as horned devils or demonic servants of Shivaska).)))
