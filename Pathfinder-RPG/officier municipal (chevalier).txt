Les officiers municipaux garantissent l'ordre dans les rues étroites et les allées sombres des settlements. 

===Compétences de classe===
Perception est une compétence de classe pour les officiers municipaux. Cela modifie les compétences de classe du chevalier.

====Appréhender (Ext)====
A constable gains Improved Unarmed Strike as a bonus feat and can attempt a grapple combat maneuver check in place of the attack at the end of a charge. At 2nd level, the constable receives a +1 bonus on Perception checks and combat maneuver checks to disarm, grapple, or trip opponents. At 7th level and every 5 levels thereafter, this bonus improves by 1. At 4th level, the constable does not treat crowds as difficult terrain. This ability replaces mount. 

====Commandant d'escadron (Ext)====
À partir du 3ème niveau, un officier municipal peut passer 1 minute à préparer un plan pour activer sa capacité tacticien sans avoir à le décompter de son nombre d'utilisations quotidiennes. Cette capacité doit être déclenchée dans l'heure au cours duquel le plan a été établi et ses bénéfices and the benefits last for 1 minute per cavalier level he has. The constable can have only one plan at a time, and if a new plan is made, any old plan is lost. This ability replaces cavalier’s charge. 

====Quick Interrogator (Ext)====
At 4th level, a constable can attempt a Diplomacy check to gather information in 1d6 × 5 minutes and attempt a Diplomacy or Intimidate check to change someone’s attitude in 5 rounds. This ability replaces expert trainer. 

====Badge (Ex)====
At 5th level, a constable’s badge becomes a powerful symbol of rules and authority. As long as he wears his badge, allies within 30 feet who can see him gain a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm, compulsion, and fear effects and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against targets the constable has challenged. At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter, the bonuses increase by 1. This ability replaces banner. 

====Instant Order (Ex)====
At 11th level, a constable can bark an order to an ally within 30 feet as a standard action. That ally  can instantly take a single move or standard action to comply with the order. Taking the action dazes the ally for 1 round afterward. At 20th level, the constable can use this ability as a move action, but no more than once per round. This ability replaces mighty charge and supreme charge. 

====Greater Badge (Ext)====
At 14th level, a constable can hold his badge aloft as a standard action to inspire his allies to be steadfast. All allies within 30 feet gain a number of temporary hit points equal to twice the constable’s cavalier level for 10 minutes. A given ally can benefit from this ability only once per day. This ability replaces greater banner.
