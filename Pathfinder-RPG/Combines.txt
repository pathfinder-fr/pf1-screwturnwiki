Combine avec un filet

(((Net Tricks
To use any of these equipment tricks, you must be proficient with nets.
* Binding Trick (Improved Dirty Trick): When you succeed at a dirty trick combat maneuver check against a target entangled by a net whose trailing rope you control, the target cannot take an action to remove the condition imposed by the dirty trick until it escapes from or bursts free of the net. 
* Grappling Net (Improved Grapple): When you attempt a grapple combat maneuver check against a foe entangled by a net whose trailing rope you control, you do not take a penalty on the grapple combat maneuver check for not having two hands free, and you gain a +4 bonus on the check. If you successfully pin the target while it is still entangled by the net, you can use the net to tie up the target as a swift action.)))

(((Thieves’ Tools Tricks

Indispensable to a rogue or any other adventurer who wishes to crack open a lock or disable a trap, a set of thieves’ tools contains a number of sharp picks and coarse files.
* Dirty Pick (Disable Device 1 rank): You don’t take any penalties for using a set of thieves’ tools as an improvised melee weapon. A set of thieves’ tools used as an improvised weapon deals 1d3 points of piercing damage. Additionally, when you attempt a dirty trick combat maneuver check to impose the blinded condition with a set of thieves’ tools, you don’t provoke an attack of opportunity. Masterwork thieves’ tools grant a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls and combat maneuver checks for these purposes.
* Let Myself In (Knowledge [engineering] 3 ranks): Whenever you succeed at a Disable Device check to unlock an object that requires a move action to open, such as a door, you can immediately open that object as a free action instead.
* Ranged Chicanery (Disable Device 1 rank, Sleight of Hand 1 rank, ability to cast mage hand): You can use mage hand to attempt Disable Device and Sleight of Hand checks at range. Working at a distance increases the normal skill check DC by an amount equal to 5 + 1 for every 5 feet the range is greater than 25 feet. You can’t take 10 or 20 on this check. Any object manipulated must weigh 5 pounds or less. If you also possess the ranged legerdemain class feature, you no longer increase the skill check DC by 5 while using Disable Device and Sleight of Hand at range.)))

(((Wondrous Item Tricks

You can use these tricks with any wondrous item that can be worn in a specific magic item slot, such as the body or wrists.
* Aura Mastery (Use Magic Device 1 rank): Once per day, you can choose a single school of magic represented by one of your wondrous items’ auras; you treat your caster level as 1 higher when casting a single spell of that school. You can make this choice at any time during the day, but you must choose the item (and school) before casting the spell.
* Counter Dispelling (Spellcraft 3 ranks): When a foe attempts a dispel check, such as via dispel magic, against either a wondrous item that you are currently wearing or wielding or a spell effect created by such an item, you can use your ranks in Use Magic Device as the item’s caster level instead of its actual caster level when calculating the dispel check DC. You must be aware of the spell that is being cast and identify it with a successful Spellcraft check in order to receive this benefit.
* Favored Item (Magical Aptitude): Once per day, you can spend 1 hour practicing with a wondrous item to designate it as your favored item for that day. If the favored item functions for a specific number of rounds or minutes per day greater than 1 round or 1 minute, you increase the maximum number of rounds or minutes it can function that day by an amount equal to half your ranks in Use Magic Device (minimum 1 round).)))

(((Heavy Blade Scabbard Tricks
In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirement listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (heavy blade scabbard) feat to use a trick. You may use these tricks with any sword scabbard designed for a heavy blade (see the fighter weapon groups on page 56 of the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook). At your GM’s discretion, you may be able to use some of these tricks with a scabbard intended for a light blade, but that requires a separate Equipment Trick feat and may be less effective.
* Capture Weapon (Improved Disarm): When you successfully disarm an opponent’s manufactured weapon, as a free action you may flip the disarmed weapon into your scabbard so long as the weapon would fit there. If you are not holding the scabbard in hand and attempt this, you have a –4 penalty on the disarm check. At the GM’s discretion, you can also use this trick on any item the opponent is holding as long as it would fit in your scabbard (such as a wand). You can only use this trick if you are wearing or holding your empty scabbard.
* Find the Hidden (Blind-Fight): You can use your scabbard to probe for hidden dangers. As a move action, you may sweep your scabbard through an adjacent square where you suspect there is an invisible creature; make a touch attack and roll the miss chance normally. If it hits and you have an available attack, you may attack that target once with a –2 penalty and no miss
chance for invisibility. All other attacks you make against that creature (whether in that round or otherwise) do not gain this benefit (though you can sweep again on your next turn). 
* Grab Purchase (Climb 5 ranks): You can use your scabbard as leverage to halt a fall, keep yourself from getting dragged, or prevent other sorts of involuntary movement by grabbing your scabbard with a free hand, jamming it into a hard surface, and
clinging to it. Whenever you fail a Climb check, you may attempt to catch yourself while falling with a +10 bonus; your GM may rule that some walls require you to hold your scabbard with two hands rather than one or are too smooth for this trick to work. If subjected to involuntary movement such as a bull rush, you may spend a move action from your next turn to use your scabbard as an anchor, giving you a +5 bonus to your CMD to resist the movement. If you spend this move action, you only get a standard action during your next turn.
* Hurl Scabbard (Quick Draw): You can draw your weapon in such a way that you send your combat scabbard (see page 3) whirling off to strike at any creature in sight. This ranged attack is a swift action and is treated as a thrown weapon.
* Steer Opponent (Improved Bull Rush): You can use your scabbard to move a foe into the perfect position for you to make your attack. As a swift action, use your scabbard to make a bull rush against an opponent. If you succeed, instead of pushing him back, you direct your target into the path of your next attack. You gain a +2 bonus on your next attack roll against the target, and +1 for every additional 5 feet your bull rush could have pushed your opponent if you had chosen to push him back. If you fail the bull rush attempt, you are considered flat-footed against that target until your next turn.
* Tangle Leg (Improved Trip, Throw Anything): When you draw your weapon, you may send its combat scabbard whirling off to strike an opponent’s legs. This bonus attack is a swift action and requires you to make a trip attack against the target. The
target can be no larger than your own size category, and the range penalty applies to your trip attempt. If you succeed, the target is knocked prone. Failing this attempt does not knock you prone unless you are within your opponent’s reach.)))

(((Shield Tricks
In addition to the feat, skill, or other requirement listed for each of these tricks, you must have the Equipment Trick (shield) feat and proficiency in (non-tower) shields to use a trick. You may use these tricks with any light or heavy shield. At your GM’s discretion, you may be able to use some of these tricks with a tower shield or buckler, but that requires a separate Equipment Trick feat for that kind of shield and may add a penalty on the associated roll.
* Break Ground (Improved Trip, Throw Anything): In place of a melee attack, you can throw your shield at an opponent’s feet, interfering with his movement and perhaps tripping him. You must be holding (not wearing) your shield or using a throwing shield to use this trick. Make a trip attack against your opponent. The opponent can be no larger than your own size category, and the range penalty applies to your trip attempt. If you succeed, the target is knocked prone. Failing this attempt does not knock you prone unless you are within your opponent’s reach. Whether or not you succeed, as long as your shield remains where you threw it, the opponent treats that square as difficult terrain until he moves out of the square.
* Hurl Shield (Throw Anything): You can throw your shield as a ranged improvised weapon. You must be holding (not wearing) your shield to perform this trick. If you are using a throwing shield, there is no reason to use this trick.
* Little Wall (Escape Artist 5 ranks): You can contort your body behind your shield in order to gain a brief moment of security. Whenever you use the total defense action, you may choose to gain cover instead of the normal dodge bonus to AC.
* Keen Eye (Perception 5 ranks): You have mastered the art of using the reflective surface of your shield to locate foes that you dare not look at directly. On your turn, you may choose to forfeit your shield’s AC bonus for 1 round to improve your defenses against one creature using a gaze attack. Your chance to avoid having to make a saving throw against that creature’s gaze attack increases to 100%, and the creature does not gain concealment against you. For every 5 ranks in Perception you have above 5, you may simultaneously use this ability against another creature with a gaze attack.
* Release Shield (no prerequisites): You may remove a light or heavy shield as a swift action instead of a move action. You may remove a throwing shield (see page 5) as a free action. Once you’ve removed the shield, you may hold it in one hand or drop it as a free action.
* Ricochet Shield (Deadly Aim, Throw Anything): When you throw a shield, you can bounce it off one or more hard surfaces in order to strike a target from an unexpected angle or to bypass an obstacle such as cover. Each object you ricochet your shield off of imposes a –2 penalty on the attack roll. Range increments apply for the total distance the shield travels, not just the direct distance between you and the target.
* Shield Gag (Improved Grapple, Throw Anything): You can force your shield into the mouth of a creature to prevent it from using bite attacks or other mouthbased abilities. Make a grapple check against a creature at least two sizes larger than your size category. If you succeed, you wedge your shield into its mouth. At any time you may release your shield, which means you
both lose the grappled condition and return to your own squares, though your shield remains in its mouth. The creature may remove the shield by destroying it (or leaving it with the broken condition), forcing the shield out of its mouth with a grapple check against your CMB, or swallowing it (if it has the swallow whole ability) as if the shield were a creature.
While the shield is in place, the monster cannot use its mouth to make attacks (such as a bite or a giant frog’s sticky tongue) against anything but the shield and cannot speak clearly enough to cast spells or use items requiring speech. If it uses a breath weapon, its range is half normal and any damage dealt must first get through the shield, with any remaining damage affecting the area normally.)))
