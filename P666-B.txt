Minerais, épices, perles, huile... mais plus que les autres membres de cette expédition, vous avez une idée du commerce\\nflorissant que cela représente si ce projet vient à aboutir.

Dervish dancers enter a near-mystical trance that allows them to push their bodies beyond normal limits.</i>\\n\\n<b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>\\nDervish dancers gain weapon proficiency with the scimitar and kukri.\\nThis ability replaces their proficiency with the rapier and whip.\\n\\n<b>Battle Dance</b>\\nA dervish dancer is trained in the use of the Perform skill, especially dance, to create magical effects on himself. This works like bardic performance, except the dervish dancer only affects himself, and does not need to be able to see or hear his own performance. Battle dancing is treated as bardic performance for the purposes of feats, abilities, effects, and the like that affect bardic performance, except that battle dancing does not benefit from the Lingering Performance feat or any other ability that allows a bardic performance to grant bonuses after it has ended. Battle dancing benefits apply only when the bard is wearing light or no armor. Like bardic performance, it cannot be maintained at the same time as other performance abilities.\\n\\nStarting a battle dance is a move action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. Changing a battle dance from one effect to another requires the dervish dancer to stop the previous performance and start the new one as a move action. Like a bard, a dervish dancer’s performance ends immediately if he is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action each round. A dervish dancer cannot perform more than one battle dance at a time. At 10th level, a dervish dancer can start a battle dance as a swift action instead of a move action.\\n\\nDervish dancers gain the inspire courage, inspire greatness, and inspire heroics bardic performance types as battle dances, but these only provide benefit to the dervish dancer himself.\\n\\n<b>Rain of Blows (Su)</b>\\nAt 6th level, a dervish dancer can use his battle dance to speed up his attacks. When making a full attack action, he may make one extra attack with any weapon he is holding, as though under the effects of a haste spell. He also gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +1 dodge bonus to AC and on Reflex saves. At 9th level, and every three bard levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by +1, to a maximum of +5 at 18th level. These bonuses do not stack with the haste spell.\\n\\nThis ability replaces suggestion and mass suggestion.\\n\\n<b>Razor’s Kiss (Su)</b>\\nAt 8th level, a dervish dancer can use his battle dance to improve his weapons’ critical range. All attacks he makes with manufactured weapons are treated as though he had the Improved Critical feat. Natural weapons and spells are not affected.\\n\\nThis ability replaces dirge of doom.\\n\\n<b>Leaf on the Wind (Su)</b>\\nAt 14th level, a dervish dancer can use his battle dance to evade attacks with unearthly grace and to shake off the effects of his wounds. Unlike other battle dances, leaf on the wind requires a standard action each round to start or maintain the performance. Each round it is maintained, including the first, the dervish dancer gains a +6 dodge bonus to Armor Class and on Reflex saves. If wounded, he heals 1 hit point of damage per bard level.\\n\\nThis ability replaces frightening tune.\\n\\n\\n<b>Fleet (Su)</b>\\nWhile performing a battle dance, a dervish dancer gains a +10 enhancement bonus to his land speed. This bonus increases by 5 feet for every four bard levels gained after 1st level, to a maximum of +30 feet at 17th level.\\n\\nThis ability replaces bardic knowledge and lore master.\\n\\n<b>Versatile Dance (Ex)</b>\\nAt 2nd level, a dervish dancer gains a bonus equal to half his level on Perform (dance) checks. He can use his bonus for his Perform (dance) skill in place of his bonus for Acrobatics.\\n\\nThis ability replaces versatile performance.\\n\\n\\n<b>Dance of Fury (Su)</b>\\nAt 12th level, a dervish dancer can attack more than once as he moves while performing a battle dance. He can combine a full-attack action with a single move, taking the attacks at any point during his movement, but must move at least 5 feet between each attack. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.\\n\\nThis ability replaces soothing performance.\\n\\n\\n<b>Battle Fury (Su)</b>\\nAt 20th level, the dervish dancer can unleash a whirlwind of blows while performing a battle dance. As a full-round action, he can take a single move action and unleash a single attack at his highest bonus against each target within his reach during any point of his move, up to a maximum number of attacks equal to the dervish dancer’s character level. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal.\\n\\nThis ability replaces deadly performance.\\n\\n\\n\\n<b>B A R D</b>\\n\\n\\n<b>Bardic Performance</b>\\nA bard is trained to use the Perform skill to create magical effects on those around him, including himself if desired. He can use this ability for a number of rounds per day equal to 4 + his Charisma modifier. At each level after 1st a bard can use bardic performance for 2 additional rounds per day. Each round, the bard can produce any one of the types of bardic performance that he has mastered, as indicated by his level.\\n\\nStarting a bardic performance is a standard action, but it can be maintained each round as a free action. Changing a bardic performance from one effect to another requires the bard to stop the previous performance and start a new one as a standard action. A bardic performance cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the bard is killed, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round. A bard cannot have more than one bardic performance in effect at one time.\\n\\nAt 7th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a move action instead of a standard action. At 13th level, a bard can start a bardic performance as a swift action.\\n\\nEach bardic performance has audible components, visual components, or both.\\n\\nIf a bardic performance has audible components, the targets must be able to hear the bard for the performance to have any effect, and many such performances are language dependent (as noted in the description). A deaf bard has a 20% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with an audible component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Deaf creatures are immune to bardic performances with audible components.\\n\\nIf a bardic performance has a visual component, the targets must have line of sight to the bard for the performance to have any effect. A blind bard has a 50% chance to fail when attempting to use a bardic performance with a visual component. If he fails this check, the attempt still counts against his daily limit. Blind creatures are immune to bardic performances with visual components.\\n\\n\\n<b>L I S T - O F - B A R D I C - P E R F O R M A N C E S</b>\\n\\n<b>Countersong (Su):</b> At 1st level, a bard learns to counter magic effects that depend on sound (but not spells that have verbal components.) Each round of the countersong he makes a Perform (keyboard, percussion, wind, string, or sing) skill check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by a sonic or language-dependent magical attack may use the bard’s Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the countersong is already under the effect of a non-instantaneous sonic or language-dependent magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it hears the countersong, but it must use the bard’s Perform skill check result for the save. Countersong does not work on effects that don’t allow saves. Countersong relies on audible components.\\n\\n<b>Distraction (Su):</b> At 1st level, a bard can use his performance to counter magic effects that depend on sight. Each round of the Distraction, he makes a Perform (act, comedy, dance, or oratory) skill check. Any creature within 30 feet of the bard (including the bard himself) that is affected by an illusion (pattern) or illusion (figment) magical attack may use the bard’s Perform check result in place of its saving throw if, after the saving throw is rolled, the Perform check result proves to be higher. If a creature within range of the Distraction is already under the effect of a non-instantaneous illusion (pattern) or illusion (figment) magical attack, it gains another saving throw against the effect each round it sees the Distraction, but it must use the bard’s Perform check result for the save. Distraction does not work on effects that don’t allow saves. Distraction relies on visual components.\\n\\n\\n<b>Fascinate (Su):</b> At 1st level, a bard can use his performance to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with him. Each creature to be fascinated must be within 90 feet, able to see and hear the bard, and capable of paying attention to him. The bard must also be able to see the creatures affected. The Distraction of a nearby combat or other dangers prevents the ability from working. For every three levels a bard has attained beyond 1st, he can target one additional creature with this ability.\\n\\nEach creature within range receives a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the bard’s level + the bard’s Cha modifier) to negate the effect. If a creature’s saving throw succeeds, the bard cannot attempt to fascinate that creature again for 24 hours. If its saving throw fails, the creature sits quietly and observes the performance for as long as the bard continues to maintain it. While fascinated, a target takes a –4 penalty on skill checks made as reactions, such as Perception checks. Any potential threat to the target allows the target to make a new saving throw against the effect. Any obvious threat, such as someone drawing a weapon, casting a spell, or aiming a weapon at the target, automatically breaks the effect.\\n\\nFascinate is an enchantment (compulsion), mind-affecting ability. Fascinate relies on audible and visual components in order to function.\\n\\n\\n<b>Inspire Courage (Su):</b> A 1st level bard can use his performance to inspire courage in his allies (including himself), bolstering them against fear and improving their combat abilities. To be affected, an ally must be able to perceive the bard’s performance. An affected ally receives a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and fear effects and a +1 competence bonus on attack and weapon damage rolls. At 5th level, and every six bard levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +1, to a maximum of +4 at 17th level. Inspire courage is a mind-affecting ability. inspire courage can use audible or visual components. The bard must choose which component to use when starting his performance.\\n\\n<b>Inspire Competence (Su):</b> A bard of 3rd level or higher can use his performance to help an ally succeed at a task. The ally must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the bard. The ally gets a +2 competence bonus on skill checks with a particular skill as long as she continues to hear the bard’s performance. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the bard has attained beyond 3rd (+3 at 7th, +4 at 11th, +5 at 15th, and +6 at 19th).\\n\\nCertain uses of this ability are infeasible, such as Stealth, and may be disallowed at the GM’s discretion. A bard can’t inspire competence in himself. inspire competence relies on audible components.\\n\\nWell-Versed (Ex)\\nAt 2nd level, the bard becomes resistant to the bardic performance of others, and to sonic effects in general. The bard gains a +4 bonus on saving throws made against bardic performance, sonic, and language-dependent effects.","dons":"<align=center>~~ O ~~</center>\\n\\n<b>Magnum Opus (Don Histoire)</b>\\n<i>You seek to create a true masterpiece.</i>\\n\\nPrerequisite: You must either have sold five or more self-created works of art worth a total of at least 5,000 gp, have performed at least five performances for audiences of 50 or more while achieving a great performance result or better on your Perform check, or have the Virtuoso background.\\n\\nBenefit: Choose a single Craft or Perform skill.

You can’t improve an NPC’s attitude beyond friendly in this way, but if you would have made them helpful, you gain a +2 bonus on your next normal Diplomacy check against that NPC attempted within 24 hours.\\n\\nIf the campaign uses the contact rules (Ultimate Campaign 148), seeing you perform can count as up to four of the five positive interactions required to cultivate a contact.","languesbool":00LBR00"0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0"00RBR00,"langues":"Tian (free)\\nHon La (Intel)\\nInfernal (Intel)\\n\\nDraconique\\nGéant","notescapacités":"\\n\\nB U I L D\\n\\nLevel 4 - Improved Feint\\n\\nLevel 5 - Diva Style\\n\\nLevel 7 - Diva Strike\\n\\nLevel 9 - Greater Feint\\n\\nLevel 10 - Discordant Voice\\n\\nLien Performance Battle https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/other-rules/performance-combat/","cnom":00LBR00"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Conseiller/Intendant","","Danse","","","","","",""00RBR00,"crangs":00LBR00"0","3","0","0","3","0","0","1","0","1","1","0","1","0","1","0","0","3","0","0","3","0","0","0","0","3","3","3","1","0","3","0","0","3","3","3","0","0","0","0","1","0"00RBR00,"cclasse":00LBR00"1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","1","0","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","0","1","1","1","1","1","1","1","0","1","1"00RBR00,"cdivers":00LBR00"0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","7","0","8","0","0","0","0","0","0"00RBR00,"cnote":00LBR00"(Utilise Danse, versalite Performance)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","(=Intendant)","","","","","","+1 trait","","","","","","","","+2 trait +3 Talent , Take 10 = Take 12+2 outils de maître","+1 pour savoir le vrai prix des choses (Trait Merchant)","+2 trait +2 Dervish +2 Don histoire, Take 10 = Take 15, +2 Chaussons de danse","","","","","","(Utilise Danse, Versatile Performance)"00RBR00,"notescompétences":"6 + 2 + 2 (Background)\\n\\nCompétences background : Danse, Profession (Intendant)","sortsparjour":00LBR00"///","4","","","","","","","",""00RBR00,"sortsconnus":00LBR00"6","4","","","","","","","",""00RBR00,"dd":00LBR00"","","","","","","","","",""00RBR00,"domaines":"","sorts":"<b>Alternate favorite class bonus</b>\\nHumans\\tAdd one spell known from the bard spell list.
